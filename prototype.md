# Prototype your design!

**Design process**
1. Empathize
2. Define
3. Ideate
  * Try stuff, reframe problems
4. Prototype
5. Test

* You iterate over the last 3 steps in order to come to a refined solution
* Prototyping raises questions that we didn't think to ask.

* Go is a great language for writing prototypes.
* Prototyping allows us to *build* our way to good design.

> Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
