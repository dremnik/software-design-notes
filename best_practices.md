Go Best Practices
-----------------

* Read the standard library.. that is the gold standard for Go code.
* One of the things being consistenly mentioned is the insistence on using the go *toolchain*.
* People also emphasize the usage of *interfaces*.
* *Think about things the GO way*.
* Spend some time understanding named and unnamed types. They are the basis of your type interchangeability. 
  Next, spend some time understanding the laws of reflection. 
  It’s a great source of confusion but if you understand the DNA of types, they will save you a lot of time.
* **Simplicity** is being emphasized.

>Write Go like Go. Don’t try to write it like some other language. 
>It’s not Java, it’s not Python, it’s not Ruby. It’s Go. That means use small interfaces. 
>Return an error if something can fail. Make your code simple, not clever. 
>Be merciless in your push for simplicity.
